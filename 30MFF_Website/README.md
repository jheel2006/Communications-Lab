# Adventures of Sleepy Steve

## Project Description:
Adventures of Sleepy Steve is a web project designed to provide an engaging and entertaining approach to improving sleep hygiene by using Steve, a stick figure who take center stage in the website. The overall concept revolves around showing Steve's transformative journey, from a sleep-deprived character to a guide offering valuable sleep tips. The theme combines a sense of fun with a touch of minimalism, offering visitors a unique and enjoyable experience. The color scheme, font choices, and layout contribute to the overall theme, creating an atmosphere that captures the essence of Steve's exciting journey.

## Process:
The implementation of Adventures of Sleepy Steve involved several key steps:

1. **Conceptualization:**
   - Defined the overarching theme of sleep hygiene and concept of using the video as a means of showcasing Sleepy Steve's adventures.
   - Brainstormed and outlined the structure of the website to effectively tell the story.

2. **Design and Styling:**
   - Selected a suitable color palette and fonts to match the adventurous theme.
   - Created CSS styles to enhance the visual appeal and readability of the content.

3. **Interactive Elements:**
   - Incorporated elements like a carousel at the beginning of the site as well as the ability to learn more details about the sleep tips.
   - Ensured smooth transitions and an interactive interface for users to navigate through the content, especially by using different colours from the colour scheme (Example: changing the colour when the mouse arrow hovers over a sleep tip).

4. **Testing:**
   - Conducted thorough testing on browsers (Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge) to identify and address any compatibility issues.
   - Tested functionality multiple times to guarantee intuitive user experience.


## Reflection/Evaluation:
Creating Adventures of Sleepy Steve was a fun and informative journey that allowed me to explore web design and its enormous potential. The project successfully captures the envisioned theme, providing users with an enjoyable and insightful adventure alongside Sleepy Steve. 

**Expectations and Goals:**
   - The idea of using the website to convey a meaningful message was effectively incorporated by addressing the widespread issue of sleep deprivation
   - The goal of creating an engaging and visually appealing website was met, with the chosen design elements contributing to a captivating user experience.

**Challenges:**
   - Defining the purpose of the site (how to brand the video) required thoughtful consideration. 
   - Alignment of text and images proved to be a recurring challenge in the design process.

**Future Improvements:**
   - Creating dedicated pages on the site to elaborate on the various sleep tips rather than linking to external sources.

In conclusion, Adventures of Sleepy Steve successfully brings Sleepy Steve's journey to life in a digital space, achieving the desired balance of entertainment and functionality. The project showcases the potential of combining storytelling with web design to create a memorable online experience.
