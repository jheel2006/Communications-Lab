# Interactive Comics Project: "Day in the Life of a Cat"

## Project Description
"Day in the Life of a Cat" is an engaging and interactive web-based comic that takes you on a fictional journey through the eyes of a cat. The story revolves around the cat's quest to find its food, offering a unique and entertaining perspective on daily life. Our goal is to create a visually attractive and enjoyable comics website, exploring the potential for a fun and interactive guide to the NYUAD campus.

## Concept and Theme
The implementation of this concept involved a collaborative effort to bring together illustration and real-life photography. The frames of the story were crafted by combining illustrations of the cat with photographs of the NYUAD campus. This style although not new, as used in the cartoon <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChILaL0YhYvUS8UGBMMROWw">My Dad is a Dragon"</a> for example, gives the story a bright and light energy, also providing a different perspective to look at mundane daily life events.

## Website Interaction
The website integrates interactive features to craft an immersive user experience. The page-turning interaction mirrors the experience similar to traditional comic reading. In addition, the scrolling animation also assists in maintaining users' attetion. The website also features a sound element which can be turned on or off by the user in order to offer an immersive experience while also considering user experience.

## Reflection
The initial concept centered around utilizing surrounding materials and real-life characters, with a specific focus on the campus cat, to create a captivating fictional story. The integration of the campus cat into the narrative served as a way to connect the audience with the familiar environment of NYUAD. By adhering to McCloud's comic principles, our project has successfully achieved storytelling through effective closure, and a thoughtful integration of words and images. The application of these principles enhances the narrative flow and reader engagement, creating a cohesive and immersive storytelling experience. However, other improvements can be applied such as creating sound interactions or incorporating other types of users' interaction.
