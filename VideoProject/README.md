# How to find a partner for your origami swan? ([Website Link](https://jheel2006.github.io/VideoProject/))

## Description
Discover the art of origami like never before with 'How to find a partner for your origami swan?' This interactive website offers a journey into the world of origami, presenting three engaging video tutorials that showcases the crafting process of elegant swan origami figures. 
Our goal is to provide users with both practical instruction and a touch of creativity. Beyond simply learning the techniques of origami, we invite users to immerse themselves in a narrative woven with themes of love and beauty. What if an origami creation also harbored desires for companionship and cared about its appearance? Through our innovative approach, we explore the hypothetical scenario of an origami's romantic escapades, painting a vivid picture of what a date in the world of folded paper might entail. 
By interacting with our website, users will not only learn the craft but also gain a newfound appreciation for origami as a labor of love.

## Process
The implementation of the project is divided into three parts: developing the storyline, shooting, and editing & website building.
We booked a set of GH5 and a light from the Equipment Center and we shot it in studio 013. Having a clear shotlist really helps with the construction of the concept. All the three of us were involved in the 1:30h shooting. For editing, we used Davinci Resolve and Final Cut Pro and the editing took around 3h. While editing sound, we stumbled upon issues regarding finding sounds that perfectly matched the video. 
Since origami is a still object, the idea of using stop motion to showcase some parts easily crosses our minds. We hope exploration on these varieties of forms can keep the users engaged. 
The website implementation emphasizes simplicity, employing a clean interface with an aesthetic and calming color scheme. Rather than overwhelming the user with flashy design elements, it prioritizes the concept itself. User interactivity is central to the design, as the site engages users at every step of the process. Through intuitive navigation, users seamlessly progress through various steps, fostering a sense of involvement and ownership in their origami journey.

## Reflection
To feed into our love and interest in the vintage aesthetic, we initially wanted the concept to be based around a vintage dating website. However, after looking for inspiration and further discussion, we realized that it is not practical at all and lacks necessary user interface where it overcomplicates the whole website which makes the website misleading. We also initially wanted all music to be swan-related but we liked the twist of adding George Micheal’s “Careless Whisper” to add a bit of humor to the storyline. As a small group with only three people, we focused a lot on the development process of our ideas. How to make the concept engaging and the website effective in terms of conveying the idea. One significant hurdle in terms of website design was striking the right balance between aesthetics and functionality. Ensuring that the color scheme and minimalist design didn't compromise user experience required careful consideration and testing. Additionally, integrating user interactivity while maintaining intuitive navigation proved challenging. It was essential to design interactions that felt natural and intuitive, allowing users to seamlessly progress through each step without confusion.
